CM1102 Help Classes
=====================

Week 8
--------

This directory contains simple demonstrations and examples mainly covering the basic use of PHP and MySQL through an estate agent type use-case.

When using the examples, be sure to alter the database connection information to use your own user account and your own database running on the correct server.

In particular, examples include;
* Connecting to a MySQL database
* Creating tables
* Inserting data
* Querying data to show on a web-page


The `simple/` directory
--------------------

The directory `simple/` includes a series of scripts covering database connection, creating tables, inserting data and querying.
The file `combined.php` combines all of these ideas into one script to make it more clear how they can be used together/


The `example/` directory
------------------------

This includes an example situation, using the same database and table as in `simple`, to demonstrate how to display relevant information on a web-page and for using HTML forms for posting data to PHP to interface with the MySQL database.
